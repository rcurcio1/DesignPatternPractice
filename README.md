# Java Design Patterns Practice

## Overview

Welcome to the Java Design Patterns Practice project! This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of examples and exercises for understanding and implementing various Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Java. It's an excellent resource for developers who want to enhance their design skills and apply best practices in software development.

## Features

- **Creational Patterns:** Explore patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
  - **Singleton**
  - **Factory Method**
  - Abstract Factory
  - **Builder**
  - Prototype

- **Structural Patterns:** Understand how to compose objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
  - **Adapter**
  - Composite
  - Proxy
  - Flyweight
  - **Facade**
  - Bridge
  - Decorator

- **Behavioral Patterns:** Learn patterns that focus on effective communication and responsibility delegation among objects.
  - **Strategy**
  - **Observer**
  - Command
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - **State**
  - Visitor
  - Interpreter
  - Template Method

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-design-patterns-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd java-design-patterns-practice
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

### Usage

1. Explore the `src` directory to find examples for each design pattern.
2. Each pattern is implemented in its respective package, containing:
   - A README file explaining the pattern
   - Java classes demonstrating the pattern
   - Unit tests to validate the implementation
3. Run the unit tests to see the patterns in action and understand their behavior.

### Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the Singleton pattern:

```java
// Singleton.java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I am a Singleton!");
    }
}

// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
        singleton.showMessage();
    }
}
```
