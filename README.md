  - **Singleton**
  - **Factory Method**
  - Abstract Factory
  - **Builder**
  - Prototype

- **Structural Patterns:** Understand how to compose objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
  - **Adapter**
  - Composite
  - Proxy
  - Flyweight
  - **Facade**
  - Bridge
  - Decorator

- **Behavioral Patterns:** Learn patterns that focus on effective communication and responsibility delegation among objects.

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<username>/DesignPatternPractice.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DesignPatternPractice
   ```
4. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

### Usage

1. Explore the `src` directory to find examples for each design pattern.
2. Each pattern is implemented in its respective package
3. Run the Main.java file in each directory to see the patterns in action and understand their behavior.
